# Sentiment Analysis with Andrew Trask

This was a mini project for the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations from Udacity.

The main lessons learned were:
- How to curate a dataset
- Develop a predictive theory, a correlation between input and output data
- Implement a neural network to solve the problem
- Increase signal and reduce noise in data set so that the neural network is able to learn much faster
- Increase speed of computations in the neural network by getting rid of unnecessary calculations
